------------------

	If you're the kinds person who loves to know how everything works… well, read on :).

	The CreateDocSet app is a simple apple script that runs a shell script, which invokes
	the appledoc tool with the right settings. All of the script files are contained in
	the (hidden) .support/ folder.
