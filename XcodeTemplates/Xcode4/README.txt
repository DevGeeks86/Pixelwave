XCODE 4 TEMPLATES

The Xcode 4 templates aren't available yet. The template system in Xcode 4 has been completely redesigned, but unfortunately there is no official word yet on how project templates are created. We are looking for a solution, so if you have one please post on the forum (www.pixelwave.org/forums).

Here's what you can do in the mean time:
- (Suggested method) Install the Xcode 3 templates. Create a Pixelwave project in Xcode 3 and then open it in Xcode 4.
- Set up a blank Xcode 4 project and create all the necessary links as described in http://www.pixelwave.org/docs/Bare_Bones_Project. This article describes how to set up a blank project with Xcode 3, but can be adapted to Xcode 4.
