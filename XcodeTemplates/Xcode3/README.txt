INSTALLATION
------------
	- Double click Install.app. Click 'Install'.

	IMPORTANT:
	This installer doesn't copy the templates but instead creates symbolic links to them within Xcode's templates path, so make sure not to delete or move this folder accidentally. If you must move this folder, run the installer again afterwards

	
UNINSTALLATION
--------------
	- Double click Install.app. Click 'Uninstall'.

	QUICK NOTE:
	You may uninstall and install the templates again at any point.

FAQ
----
a) Will uninstalling the template break projects that already use them?
	- No, it won't. You may uninstall or update the template files at any time.

b) What happens if I delete or move this folder?
	- Xcode won't be able to load the templates, so don't. If you did, re-download this folder from the Pixelwave website. If you must move this folder, just run the installer again and all should be well.
